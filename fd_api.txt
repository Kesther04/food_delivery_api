IMPORTANT DIRECTORIES FOR ANY BACKEND APP
* config dir - for environment specific setup files that configures how my app connects to external services
* utils dir - for keeping helper function reusable to multiple files in my app
* services dir - for doing the work required in the application at a certain level.( such as calculations or talking to db or sending emails) (this keeps controllers light)
* tests dir - for storing automated tests for the app (this is vital so that old features won't be broken due to new changes)
* controllers dir - handles request/response logic & call services for models
* models dir - defines the structure of a db doc and allows CRUD methods
* middlewares dir - functions that run b4 / after reaching controllers
* routes dir - define the API endpoints (URLs + HTTP mtds) & map them to controllers
